## ffuf

`ffuf` is a fast web fuzzer written in Go. It is used to fuzz web applications and can be used for both content discovery and directory fuzzing

To use `ffuf` for directory fuzzing, you can use the following command:
- `ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt`: This command will fuzz the URL `http://example.com/FUZZ`
- `ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -e .php,.html`: This command will fuzz the URL `http://example.com/FUZZ` and will append the extensions `.php` and `.html` to the wordlist entries
- `ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -recursion -recursion-depth 2`: This command will fuzz the URL `http://example.com/FUZZ` and will recursively fuzz the found directories up to a depth of 2


## wfuzz

`wfuzz` is a web application fuzzer that allows you to fuzz web applications for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and more. It is written in Python and is highly customizable.

To use `wfuzz` for directory fuzzing and content discovery, you can use the following command:
- `wfuzz -c -z file,/path/to/wordlist.txt http://example.com/FUZZ`: This command will fuzz the URL `http://example.com/FUZZ` using the wordlist `/path/to/wordlist.txt`
- `wfuzz -c -z file,/path/to/wordlist.txt -t 10 http://example.com/FUZZ`: This command will fuzz the URL `http://example.com/FUZZ` using the wordlist `/path/to/wordlist.txt` with 10 threads
- `wfuzz -c -z file,/path/to/wordlist.txt --hc 404 http://example.com/FUZZ`: This command will fuzz the URL `http://example.com/FUZZ` using the wordlist `/path/to/wordlist.txt` and will ignore 404 responses


## nmap

`nmap` is a powerful network scanning tool that can be used to discover hosts and services on a network. It is commonly used for security auditing and network inventory.

To use `nmap` for host discovery and port scanning, you can use the following command:
- `nmap -sn target`: This command will perform a ping scan on the target host to discover live hosts 
- `nmap -sS -p 1-65535 -T4 -A -v target`: This command will perform a SYN scan on all ports, use aggressive scanning options, and provide verbose output for the target host
