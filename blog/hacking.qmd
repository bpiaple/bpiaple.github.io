## ffuf

`ffuf` is a fast web fuzzer written in Go. It is used to fuzz web applications and can be used for both content discovery and directory fuzzing

To use `ffuf` for directory fuzzing, you can use the following command:

- ```bash
ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
```
This command will fuzz the URL `http://example.com/FUZZ` using the wordlist `/path/to/wordlist.txt`

- ```bash 
ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -e .php,.html
```
This command will fuzz the URL `http://example.com/FUZZ` and will append the extensions `.php` and `.html` to the wordlist entries
- ```bash
ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt recursion-depth 2
```
This command will fuzz the URL `http://example.com/FUZZ` and will recursively fuzz the found directories up to a depth of 2

- ```bash 
ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -recursion-depth 2 -e .php,.html
``` 
This command will fuzz the URL `http://example.com/FUZZ` and will recursively fuzz the found directories up to a depth of 2 and will append the extensions `.php` and `.html` to the wordlist entries

## wfuzz

`wfuzz` is a web application fuzzer that allows you to fuzz web applications for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and more. It is written in Python and is highly customizable.

To use `wfuzz` for directory fuzzing and content discovery, you can use the following command:

- ```bash
fuzz -c -u http://example.com/login.php -d "username=admin&password=FUZZ" -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
```
This command will fuzz the POST parameter `password` in the URL `http://example.com/login.php` with the wordlist `/path/to/wordlist.txt`

- ```bash
wfuzz -c -z file/path/to/wordlist.txt http://example.com/FUZZ
```
This command will fuzz the URL `http://example.com/FUZZ` using the wordlist `/path/to/wordlist.txt`
- `wfuzz -c -z file,/path/to/wordlist.txt -t 10 http://example.com/FUZZ`: This command will fuzz the URL `http://example.com/FUZZ` using the wordlist `/path/to/wordlist.txt` with 10 threads
- `wfuzz -c -z file,/path/to/wordlist.txt --hc 404 http://example.com/FUZZ`: This command will fuzz the URL `http://example.com/FUZZ` using the wordlist `/path/to/wordlist.txt` and will ignore 404 responses


## nmap

`nmap` is a powerful network scanning tool that can be used to discover hosts and services on a network. It is commonly used for security auditing and network inventory.

To use `nmap` for host discovery and port scanning, you can use the following command:
- `nmap -sn target`: This command will perform a ping scan on the target host to discover live hosts 
- `nmap -sS -p 1-65535 -T4 -A -v target`: This command will perform a SYN scan on all ports, use aggressive scanning options, and provide verbose output for the target host

## searchsploit

searchsploit is a command-line search tool for Exploit Database, which is a repository of exploits and vulnerable software. It allows you to search for exploits based on software name, version, and other criteria.

To use searchsploit, you can use the following command:

- ```bash
searchsploit software_name
```
This command will search for exploits related to the software `software_name`

- ```bash
searchsploit -t software_name
```
This command will search for exploits related to the software `software_name` and display the title of the exploit

- ```bash
searchsploit -x exploit_id
```
This command will display the contents of the exploit with the ID `exploit_id`

- ```bash
searchsploit -m exploit_id
```
This command will copy the exploit with the ID `exploit_id` to the current directory

## metasploit

Metasploit is a penetration testing framework that allows you to develop, test, and execute exploit code against a remote target. It provides a wide range of tools and modules for various stages of the penetration testing process.

To use Metasploit, you can use the following commands:

- ```bash
msfconsole
```
This command will start the Metasploit console

- ```bash
use exploit_name
```
This command will select the exploit module `exploit_name`

- ```bash
set RHOST target_ip
```
This command will set the remote host IP address to `target_ip`

- ```bash
set RPORT target_port
```
This command will set the remote host port to `target_port`

- ```bash
set LHOST local_ip
```
This command will set the local host IP address to `local_ip`

- ```bash
exploit
```
This command will execute the selected exploit against the target host

- ```bash
run
```
This command will run the selected exploit against the target host
